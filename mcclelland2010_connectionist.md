Letting structure emerge: connectionist and dynamical systems approaches to cognition

* Emergentist approaches :
  - modeling entities as a consequence of large number of simple processes (eg. anthill)
* Probabilistic approaches :
  - entitites seen as abstractions
  - 
Both can rely on statistical computation

Task : The A-no-B task

Comparision b/w statistical models and connectionist approach on Semantic Cognition

In conclusion : authors suggest an integrated appraoch where Statistical learning helps rapid learning and the connectionist approach helps gradual learning from the abstract concepts from old knowledge. Like hippocampus and neocortex, respectively â€“ with the former helping to consolidate knowledge in the latter over time.
